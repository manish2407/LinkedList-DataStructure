# LinkedList-DataStructure
2-After the completion of Array, We are moving forward to Linked List DataStructure. In this repository, we cover all possible sample code of  all operation that is being performed on Linked List.


Linked List is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.Like arrays, Linked List is a linear data structure. Unlike arrays, linked list elements are not stored at a contiguous location; the elements are linked using pointers.


Advantages over arrays
1) Dynamic size
2) Ease of insertion/deletion


Drawbacks:
1) Random access is not allowed.
2) Extra memory space for a pointer is required with each element of the list.
3) Not cache friendly.


A linked list is represented by a pointer to the first node of the linked list. The first node is called the head. If the linked list is empty, then the value of the head is NULL.
Each node in a list consists of at least two parts:
1) data
2) Pointer (Or Reference) to the next node.

we can implement or perform various operation on linkedlist data structure like:

InsertAtHead

InsertaftergivenNode

InsertAtEnd

DeleteSpecificKey
